      <h2>Calzone Dough</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re in a pinch, grab any store-bought pizza dough to make your
        calzone. If you want to elevate your home cooking game, make your own
        pizza dough.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you’re rolling your dough out, pay special attention to the
        thickness. You want to make sure that the dough is thick enough to hold
        all the toppings and be folded over without breaking. ¼-inch thickness
        is the sweet spot.
      </p>
