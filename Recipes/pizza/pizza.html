            <em>Pizza sauce:</em> a delicious tomatoes and rich pizza sauce
            brings in the depth of flavor. Again, you can buy pre-made pizza

          <span>
            <em>Cheese:</em> Mozzarella cheese it is! Fresh mini mozzarella
            balls are stringy, cheesy, and divine.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <em>Vegetables:</em> Vegetables: red onions, bell peppers,

      <h1>How to make</h1>

      <ul>
        <span>
          <li>Prepare the dough:</li>
          <p>
            In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Add the yeast to
            warm water and let it stand for a few minutes for bubbles or foam to
            appear.
            <br />
            Pour yeasty water into the flour bowl slowly, mixing with a spoon at
            the same time. Once all the water has been added, add olive oil and
            mix with a spoon to combine.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <li>Knead dough</li>
          <p>
            Transfer the dough to a bench thatâ€™s been dusted with flour. Knead
            with your hands for about 10 minutes until the dough is elastic and
            smooth.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <li>Resting time</li>
          <p>
            Roll into a ball, tucking under the sides and allow to rest covered
            with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap for 30 -60 mintues.
            <br />
            The dough would have doubled in size. Divide into 3 even balls then
            add a touch of olive oil to the top of the balls and let them rest
            covered with cling wrap or a damp cloth for a minimum of 2 hours.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <li>Make the pizza:</li>
          <p>
            Preheat oven to its highest setting for 30 minutes with your pizza
            stone or oven tray inside. <br />
            To make the pizza shape, dust your bench with semolina flour and
            using your hands gently stretch into a pizza shape
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <li>Add toppings:</li>
          <p>
            Add your tomato sauce and favourite toppings, all except the
            mozzarella cheese. Drizzle with olive oil and brush some onto the
            crust too.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <li>Cook the Pizza:</li>
          <p>
            Gently move the pizza base to your heated pizza pan or oven tray.
            Cook in the oven on the lowest level for approximately 4-5 minutes.
            <br />
            Remove from oven, add mozzarella cheese and place back in the oven
            for 3-4 minutes until the cheese has melted.
            <br />
            Tear over some fresh basil leaves and enjoy!
